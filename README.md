# Arithmetic Circuits in C

#### Running the program for movie.ac on Linux

gcc -o ac main.c -lm

./ac movie.ac


The program also accepts a third argument, which specifies the size of the circuit

There is also a branch with cache-backpropagation - it should work but produces some minor errors on valgrind (?)
